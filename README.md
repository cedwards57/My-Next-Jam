# Project 1 - Spotify API Usage

How to use:

1. If you do not already have a Spotify account, you will need to create one. A free account is fine!

2. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.

3. Click **Create An App**, enter the necessary information, then click **Create**.

4. From the app's screen, you can find the Client ID and Client Secret. Create a file called **.env** with these contents:

> export CLIENT_ID="yourclientid"
> export CLIENT_SECRET="yourclientsecret"

replacing **yourclientid** and **yourclientsecret** with the corresponding information.

**NOTE: Keep your ID and Secret secure. The .env file is intentionally listed in the .gitignore file.**

5. When you fork this repository, place **.env** in the root. This will enable Spotify's data retrieval to work, which is, you know, core functionality of this app!

WIP. to add:

- detail all technologies, frameworks, libraries, and APIs you used for this project, and explain how someone who forks the repository would be able to get set up on the project (installations, secret files)

A. What are at least 3 technical issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?
B. What are known problems (still existing), if any, with your project?
